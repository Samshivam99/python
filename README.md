This is my first repository on github

This a python code to understand how clustering techniques are used for a K-means model using Leukemia Remission Data

As a part of Analysis, we will use Elbow and Silhouette Methods to optimize a K-means model and identify number of clusters needed to optimize. We will create visualizations for the dataset & identify insights from these newly created clusters. This will help get an understanding of clustering techniques
